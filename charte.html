                        The Dragon Quest launches every Tuesday at 7 p.m. Remember to leave a place for the kidnapped spouse for the bonus stats. 
                        The Temple of Light launches every Friday at 9 p.m. For GVGs, send your availability to the Captain of the
                        guild 1 day in advance (Monday for Tuesday, Wednesday for Thursday) so that he can make the appropriate strategies for
                        win against other guilds. The teams will be announced at 3 p.m. on D-day and the teams must be made at
                        from 7:50 p.m. to get ahead.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the pups, make at least 2 teams of 3 in order to be as efficient as possible.
                        At the Guild Ball, this is definitely the best time to use the music boxes in a group. There is a big
                        XP buff over normal time
                        If Coco is full, the Captain will send a message a day in advance to party the next day at 7 p.m. (except the
                        Tuesday or there is the Quest of the Dragon)
                        And finally the Bosses of the Ruins. They appear every Friday and Saturday at 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. To have the best
                        bidding possible, the guild must at least be top 1 in DPS out of 5 bosses out of 16. So you have to be active the most
                        possible during this event.
